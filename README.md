# Chair_Classification

This repository contains implementation of Reverse search engine on the basis of Chair image given and a Multi-class classifier of different catogeries of chairs.

For implementation follow the mentioned steps.

1). Make sure you have all dependencies installed as in requirements.txt
2). Extract the dataset and copy its extracted location.

# New-Reverse-Search-Engine.py

For its implementation, run the .py file. On running, it will ask you the path of extracted dataset, so paste path here. Further it will ask you to give test image path. As a output you will get 3 images closely related with the given image.
